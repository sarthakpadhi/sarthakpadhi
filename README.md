## Hi there 👋

I’m a full-spectrum Data Professional with expertise spanning the entire data lifecycle, from engineering large-scale architectures, to analyzing patterns, to building AI-powered solutions that drive real business impact.
With hands-on experience across Generative AI, Machine Learning, Data Science, and robust Data Engineering, I specialize in creating intelligent, scalable systems that turn ideas into outcomes. I am interested in building high-performance data systems, building ML models, and exploring the intersection of data, markets, and decision-making.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning applications in the intersection of finance and technology. Some works that I am excited to show are the [AlphAgent]{https://github.com/sarthakpadhi/AlphaAgent} Implementation and OrderBook Implementation. I am currently looking into system designs for low-latency systems for market data ingestion.
