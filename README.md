## Hi there 👋

I’m **Sarthak Padhi**, a full-spectrum Data Professional with expertise across the entire data lifecycle,  from engineering large-scale architectures, to analyzing patterns, to building AI-powered systems that drive real business impact.

With hands-on experience in **Generative AI, Machine Learning, Data Science, and robust Data Engineering**, I specialize in creating intelligent, scalable systems that turn ideas into outcomes. I’m particularly interested in building **high-performance data systems**, designing **ML models**, and exploring the intersection of **data, markets, and decision-making**.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about applications at the intersection of **finance and technology**. Some projects I’m excited to share include my [AlphaAgent](https://github.com/sarthakpadhi/AlphaAgent) implementation and my **Order Book implementation**. I’m also exploring **system design for ultra-low-latency market data ingestion**.
